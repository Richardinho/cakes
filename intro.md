### Angular documentation's Hero app demo implemented using React
React and Angular are perhaps the two most popular UI frameworks for building Single Page Applications.
Single Page Applications, (SPA for short), are challenging to build owing to the fact that they consist of a number of different complicated parts. React and Angular both provide facilities for building these parts.
In this article I want to carry out a comparative analysis of React and Angular. 
This article will be divided up into sections. Each section will cover a particular programming problem presented by SPAs and will discuss the different ways that this problem can be solved in React and Angular.
To help illustrate this discussion, I created a React application which emulates the demonstration Hero app that can be found in Angular's documentation.The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/Richardinho/react-hero-app-with-routing)
At the end of each section, I will deliver a verdict as to how well they compare, and at the end of this article I will offer an overall verdict.
