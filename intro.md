### Angular documentation's Hero app demo implemented using React
React and Angular are perhaps the two most popular UI frameworks for building Single Page Applications.
SPAs are challenging to build owing to the fact that they are comprised of a number of different parts, each of which in itself can present a considerable programming challenge.
Angular and React assist in the development of SPAs by providing solutions to these problems.
In this article I want to carry out a comparison of these solutions.
To help illustrate this discussion, I created a React application which emulates the demonstration Hero app that can be found in Angular's documentation.The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/Richardinho/react-hero-app-with-routing)
